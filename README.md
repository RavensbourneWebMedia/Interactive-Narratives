*Interactive Narratives* is about disseminating stories through online videos, memes, blogs, social media, mini-games etc.

In particular we will focus on **transmedia and non-linear storytelling**.

How can you use Transmedia to **tell a story**, **express your views**, **communicate your ideas** or **raise awareness**?
