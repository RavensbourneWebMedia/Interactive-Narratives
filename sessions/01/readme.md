# Welcome

### Rules of the road

* **Be present**. If you happen to be late or absent, make sure you email me about it before a session starts. Otherwise do not enter until the break.
* **Participate** in class debates and workshops. We'll make sure that your ideas have space to be heard and that nobody makes you feel uncomfortable about sharing them.
* **Present** your work during formative and summative assessments. If you can't make it those days then you'll record your presentation and upload it to YouTube (or similar).
* **Be responsible** for what happens in class. Organise with your peers to get class information and material that you may have missed.
* **Meet the deadlines**. If you submit your work after a deadline, your grade will be capped.
* **Blog weekly**
* **Study at home**, otherwise you will not be able to reach the expected learning.

### How much time am  I meant to spend on this project?

# Launching your project brief for term 2

The first half of the unit explores the history and formats of storytelling, looking at some of the best examples of narrative located in a variety of forms: oral storytelling, the novel, performance, the triptych, cartoons, television, and viral content online. Students will be invited to take some of these examples and create their own non-linear narratives. Over the weeks of the course, students will be expected to participate in seminary discussions during lectures, group workshops, and to present their own examples and ideas.
Students will work together in groups (three or four people per group) to create a compelling original interactive story together that is expressed via a Web interface. Or they can adapt an existing story in this way as an interactive narrative.

Over the course of the initial weeks each student within a group will develop the online persona of a character in the drama – for example creating a twitter feed, audio, photo and video uploads of their lives through the period of the drama. These materials will then be created online and will be accessed by the audience through a central Hub web page designed using the Twine interactive narrative system.

The aim will be to create an interactive narrative or augmented reality game (ARG)-type story that can be of any style or genre that groups choose (ie it can be a noire piece, comedy, a psychological thriller, a contemporary western or a combination of all four). Students will be asked to write in character, respond to one another’s blog and online entries, make short verite films and recordings, and load pictures which combined will help tell the story.

# Lecture: Introducing Trans-media

### What is Trans-media?

![studyhours](assets/Transmedia.png)

> ‘The art of storytelling now requires the creation of
a complex story structure: multi-layered, open-ended,
and involving multiple users. Storytelling today is almost
like designing a wicked problem itself.’ Jörgen Van Der Sloot

* All media are equal
* All media work together to tell the story
* Each type of media presents its own unique viewpoint
* Rich media world - work together to create their own universe...
* Not an adaptation
* Doesn’t just re-tell the same story
* Transmedia: you only get the full story by consuming all the media.
* Picture, text, film, audio, updates, blogs, characters n Fit together like a jigsaw

### Why are we doing this?

* To learn to tell stories
* To try and tell stories in new ways that fit the new digital era
* To play with interaction, Social Media and the Web
* To see how easy it is to create a ‘mask’ online
* To explore narratives suitable for games (Term 3)

### What are stories, then?

* Stories are ways of framing information.
* Stories are ways of codifying a sequence of events.
* Stories are arranged so they fall into a satisfying pattern.
* They have a beginning.
* They have a middle.
* They have an end.

### What is a non-linear story?

![studyhours](assets/non-linear.png)

* Non-Linear stories are those that are not told in any particular order.
* Non-Linear stories are those that the audience can shape and change.
* Non-Linear stories are those that we can participate in.

### Where do we find non-linear stories?

* Videogames
* ARGs
* Games played in the real world
* MMOGs
* Online Projects
* Augmenting TV and Film Narrative
* “Pervasive Games” - Games that cross between real and virtual

### Digital Storytelling

* Immersive
* Navigable
* Participatory
* Can break the fourth wall
* Blurs fiction and reality
* Uses a huge narrative canvas
* Offers a shared community experience
* Offers opportunity to change character PoV
* Can be malleable
* Stories are active

### Workshop: Find case studies, analyse and present.

#### Can interactive narratives have the same dramatic effect as linear narratives?

**Spend 30-minutes researching and preparing a short presentation of Trans-Media Examples:**
1. What?
2. Where?
3. Who played?
4. Who made?
5. How was the story told?
6. Find us a video clip!

### Workshop: Ideation

### Characters

* The foundations of your story
* They need to be believable
* They need to be consistent
* They need to be able to grow
* They need to be interesting
* Archetypes not stereotype

### Archetype

Are you a...
willing hero, unwilling hero, anti hero, tragic, loner, mentor, shaman, trickster, fool, seductress, empress, hermit, wanderer, hunter, strongman, judge, death devil, dreeb, romantic, loyalist, angel, athlete, avenger, beggar, bully, detective, father, gossip, delicate flower, messiah, shape- shifter, slave, victim, visionary or nerd?

#### What they look like?

<!--
* Step 1: Find ways you are going to capture your stories
* Step 2: Begin ideating Characters
* Step 3: Begin ideating storylines

This only needs to be bear bone -->

**How are you going to capture the first initial character and story?**

I think you should get some pens and paper out!

* Storyboard
* Media map

* Steal a photograph from Flickr (or a dating
site...) Search for the archetype terms and then grab the first picture that takes your fancy

### Age/Nationality/Race
* Look at the picture
* How old are you?
* Where are you from?
* What race are you?

### Background
* Where have you lived in the past?
* Where do you live now?
* What did you do before?
* Where are your family?

* What are your bad habits?
* What can’t you stop yourself doing?

### Fears and motivations
* What drives you?
* Money, revenge, love, sex, fame, kindness, loss, happiness?
* What are you frightened of?
* Pain, rejection, loneliness, loss of status, hunger, others?
* What do you think of yourself?

### Online Mannerisms
* How does all this manifest itself?

* Begin communicating!
* Try to achieve your goals

The Rules
* Do it for real – think it through – be that person when you are online.

* All communication on Twitter. We need to follow the story.
* Contact at least all the other people on your list, then follow / communicate with others
* Have fun, be imaginative, believe in it and see what happens.
* No bullying or freaking ‘real’ people out!

# Homework

### Peer-learning mini-lessons

In small teams, you will research one web/internet concept or technique and prepare a **mini-lesson** (~15 minutes) to teach everyone else about it.

Make your presentation **interactive**!

It's a form of **cooperative** learning, that is: learning from *each other, together*.

In peer learning, everybody plays both the **teacher** and the **learner**.

By teaching to your peers, you reinforce your own learning. [It works](http://visible-learning.org/hattie-ranking-influences-effect-sizes-learning-achievement/hattie-ranking-teaching-effects)!

Also, you get to practice and build confidence in your **communication skills**.

At the end of your mini-lessons we'll give each other **feedback**. *Honest* feedback can hurt but it's through that (and practice) that we improve.

**GOING WAY BACK NOW...**
* The roots of story telling
* The roots of narrative
* The roots of interaction

### Blog

Keeping a **journal** to record your creative process is extremely important. Don't let your ideas and thoughts fade away! Think of your blog as your *digital sketchbook* (more on that [here](https://github.com/RavensbourneWebMedia/Blogging#why-blogging)). We ask you to blog regularly and we'll check that you do it every week.

**What are some of the fundamental elements (for example structure and characteristics) that are required to develop a interactive narrative and why?**
