### Three-Act Structure
**The foundations of modern storytelling**

**ACT 1: COMPLICATION**
<br>
Balance, harmony, happiness... something comes to throw the character and the balance in their life.

**ACT 2: DEVELOPMENT**
<br>
Problem worse than they thought, and character now faces a series of developments that raise the stakes..

**ACT 3: RESOLUTION**
<br>
Character learns that he or she must pit everything in his or her power to resolve this issue and to achieve their goal.

### ACT ONE: COMPLICATION
* Protagonist is shown in his/her ordinary world
* There is an event: A Call to Adventure n He/she must decide whether to answer “the call”
