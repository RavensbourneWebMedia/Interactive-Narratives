# Homework

### Peer-learning mini-lessons

Download and explore phaser.io. Next week, show the rest of the group how far you have got. 


### Blog

Keeping a **journal** to record your creative process is extremely important. Don't let your ideas and thoughts fade away! Think of your blog as your *digital sketchbook* (more on that [here](https://github.com/RavensbourneWebMedia/Blogging#why-blogging)). We ask you to blog regularly and we'll check that you do it every week.
