### Blog

Keeping a **journal** to record your creative process is extremely important. Don't let your ideas and thoughts fade away! Think of your blog as your *digital sketchbook* (more on that [here](https://github.com/RavensbourneWebMedia/Blogging#why-blogging)). We ask you to blog regularly and we'll check that you do it every week.

**What are your strength and weaknesses in relation to completing this project? And how are you going to address them?**

In addition, look at the reading list for this brief and familiarise yourself with the books.
