### Learning outcomes for this project:

**Was covered mainly in term 2:**
* An in-depth understanding of the development of storytelling and narrative structures including the main theoretical perspectives associated with narrative structure and storytelling and an awareness of the importance of storytelling to communities and cultures.

* The ability to construct a compelling and sophisticated narrative that also contains mood, structure, characterisation and that may involve the active participation of the audience, reader, listener or engager.

* A detailed understanding of how to construct and maintain stories that span multiple delivery formats simultaneously.

**Will mainly be covered in term 3:**
* An understanding of how children consume online media; knowledge of the professional considerations of making content for children (technical, physical, cognitive, societal, cultural, regulatory and ethical).

* Understanding the history of play and games culture; understanding the value of the creative use of play for serious purposes; a knowledge of the ways gaming and playful activities are being used economically and culturally by businesses, government, education and other sectors.

* An understanding of the tools and techniques available to businesses for creating games and interactive experiences for entertainment or educational purposes.

**You will be marked on these parts of your deliverables:**
* Research pack (The research which led to your board game and phaser production. For example, references to other boardgames, online games, evidence of user testing, secondary research, what did you learn, analyse, and how did it influence your final productions)
* Media assets (Graphics, layouts, typography, symbols, icons)
* Blog-posts
* Presentation
* Board game production
* Your Phaser production
* 500 word reflective report
* 500 words on core game mechanic, experience goals, objective and rules of an online game of your choice

# The missing link: Analysis and synthesis

### Analysis
Analysis is defined as “the procedure by which we break down an intellectual or substantial whole into parts or components” (Ritchey, 1991, p.1). This means breaking down interview transcripts for example into relevant themes.

### Synthesis
Synthesis is defined as the process of combining “separate elements or components in order to form a coherent whole” (Ritchey, 1991, p.1). Therefore, the synthesis stage involves revising, grouping and reorganising different themes laterally, in order to draw new insights that are not necessarily structured according to the questions asked in the discovery phase.


“Analysis and synthesis, as scientific methods, always go hand-in-hand; they complement one another. Every synthesis is built upon the results of a preceding analysis, and every analysis requires a subsequent synthesis in order to verify and correct its results. In this context, to regard one method as being inherently better than the other is meaningless.” (Ritchey, 1991, p.1)

# Homework

### Peer-learning mini-lessons

Create your paper prototype of your game, to be played next week and receive feedback.


### Blog

Keeping a **journal** to record your creative process is extremely important. Don't let your ideas and thoughts fade away! Think of your blog as your *digital sketchbook* (more on that [here](https://github.com/RavensbourneWebMedia/Blogging#why-blogging)). We ask you to blog regularly and we'll check that you do it every week.

**What is your favourite board game and why?**

In addition, look at the reading list for this brief and familiarise yourself with the books.
