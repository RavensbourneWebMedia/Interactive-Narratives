### Peer-learning mini-lessons

Read [https://github.com/RavensbourneWebMedia/Interactive-Narratives/blob/2018/sessions/03/assets/BelieveMeStoryManifesto_ReadandShare.pdf](Believe Me)


In small teams, you will research one storytelling concept or technique and prepare a **mini-lesson** (~15 minutes) to teach everyone else about it.

Your mini-lesson will be **interactive**: try and make a mini-workshop, rather than just have us listen.

### Blog

Keeping a **journal** to record your creative process is extremely important. Don't let your ideas and thoughts fade away! Think of your blog as your *digital sketchbook* (more on that [here](https://github.com/RavensbourneWebMedia/Blogging#why-blogging)). We ask you to blog regularly and we'll check that you do it every week.

**What are your strength and weaknesses in relation to completing this project? And how are you going to address them?**
