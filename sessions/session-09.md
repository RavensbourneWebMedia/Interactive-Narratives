# Presentation checklist

This is a list of topics that your presentation *should* touch upon. 

* The **narrative**
	* What's your story in *one line*?
	* What are the **events** that happen in your story-game?
	* Who are the **characters** and what are their goals?
	* How does the **plot** unfold through time on different media?
	* How did **online audiences** react to it? Why?

* The **interaction**
	* Which narrative elements are **embedded** (pre-generated parts of the story, eg: scripted scenes)?
	* Which narrative elements are **emergent** (created on-the-fly as you play)?
	* What game (stereo)**types** have you used to communicate your narrative? Why?
	* What **verbs** are powering your game(s)? Why?
	* What are the **rules** of your game(s)?
	* What are the **goals** of your game(s)? How do you win?
	* What **conflicts** are there, between players or between player and the game system?
	* What is the player's experience? What are you expected to ***feel***? 
	
* The **process**
	* What **resources** did you use (eg: tutorials, ready-made scripts, forums, libraries)?
	* How did you organise your **team work**?
	* What did you **learn**? 

Use this checklist as a starting point to structure your presentation. Don't simply answer the questions above, make it interesting!

Remember, we do value *creativity* after all ;)


# Tips

### For the presenter(s)

1. Don't start with an **apology**.   
  
	Whatever you have is what you'll present. 
* **Don't read** a script, or read from your presentation.   
  
	We can read ourselves.
* Don't be **defensive**.   
  
	We're not attacking you. 
	
	Instead of putting up a defence wall, try to listen for the feedback that can make your ideas better. 
* Be **confident**.   
  
	You know your work inside out, so speak about it with confidence.   
	
	Stand up and get your hands out of your pockets.
* Tell us a **story**, not a features list.  
  
	<!---->
* Ask **specific questions**.   
  
	Not `What do you think?` or `Do you like it?`. 
* **Smile**.   
  
	It makes people pay more attention, and it makes you sound more engaging. Simple :smile:

<!--
* Don't try to **please me**.   
  
	Our ideas may be different and I respect that. Your job is to show the value of your work, not to flatter me. 
-->

### For everyone else

1. Be **kind**.   
  
	Your comments can be challenging, but make sure the creator of the work understands that your feedback is about their work, not about them.
* Be **constructive**.   
  
	Include *suggestions*, which the creator of the work can simply take away and use.   
  
	Also consider how you frame suggestions. Saying `Why didn't make XYZ so and so?` may make the creator of the work feel like you think they're dumb or haven't done their work. Instead, try with `What do you think about making XYZ so and so?`
* Be **specific** and say **why**.   
  
	Rather than saying / writing `I don’t like XYZ` be specific about what you have an issue with, and why. Try saying / writing something like `I don’t think tXYZ reflects the user needs, because...`     
* **Focus on needs, not opinions**.
	
	Instead of a personal statement like `I hate the red button!` consider a user-focused question such as `Would users dislike the red button because it could be confused with an error message?`, which is much more effective, and also testable.
