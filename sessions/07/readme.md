# Setting the scene

### Intros

What's your favourite spy story / film?

### Craig

Craig studied computer science (as well as maths and theatre)

[Timehop](http://timehop.com/) :)

> How can we teach CS better?

[Coder Dojo Scotland](http://coderdojoscotland.com/) for young people to make programming (or more broadly *digital making*) a fun and sociable experience.

Age range: 12 - 17.

[Digital Makers Fund](http://www.nesta.org.uk/project/digital-makers): digital natives know how to use tech, but we don't have enough people with the making skills.

Female participants: 26% currently

#### Peer-based learning

* Everyone is a learner
* **Pair programming** needs a bit of discipline, need to explain that making things together is part of the fun
* Think > pair > share

#### Game-based *stealth* learning

1. What's the *hook*? (I like kittens)
* What's the *activity*? (I'm solving riddles and saving kittens)
* What's the *learning*? (I'm learning HTML & CSS)

#### Projects Craig worked on

> People don't sign up because they want to learn coding, but rather because they're fans of [MI-High](http://www.bbc.co.uk/cbbc/shows/mi-high)

[Make a MOBOT](http://coderdojoscotland.com/makeamobot/) for Virgin, using Kinect. Kids programming their secret moves. Being active was the hook, and interested in sports.

#### [Hackstage Pass](http://www.hackstagepass.co.uk/) for Radio 1

Brief: create a game that involves programming but it's not explicitly about programming. You can fix your mistakes by programming your moves.

Built together with [Player Three](http://www.playerthree.com/portfolio-type/html5)



### [Caesar cipher ](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher)

Pick a word that has repeated letters, and that kids know
`edqdqd`
`banana`

It wasn't decoded for about 700 years, until an Arab scholar (Al-Kindi) used *frequency analysis* to work it out. 

**Distributed computing**: working individually to solve small parts of the problem, and then put the solution together.

### Other techniques

[Steganography](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steganography) and [acrostic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acrostic)

**Digital steganography**: hiding messages inside digital images, by changing the least significant digits in the RGB values




# Spy-stories

Enhancing linear narratives with game-like activities and puzzles. 

Case study: digital making workshop for Children's BBC based around the TV series MI High (a spy show for kids) - it combined specially filmed videos with the actors, with a hands-on coding workshop to create an interactive drama.

Examples: [TouchTone](http://touchtonegame.com), [Decodedâ€™s substitution cypher](http://hacker.decoded.com/substitution), Mini-Game Hacks in [Alien Isolation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y-i3RwZLbio), and [Rebooting Computers in 24: The Game](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzc_i6jDdv8&t=48m0s)


### Workshop

Using [Phaser](https://phaser.io/learn).

Keywords: digital lock-picking, cryptography, [steganography](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steganography)

Conceptualise and hack together a puzzle mini-game that complements your main story (eg: 310515.com) and reveals / unlocks parts of the story. 




# Homework

Play-test your team game(s) with players (to be recruited). Write a  report (MD to GitHub)
